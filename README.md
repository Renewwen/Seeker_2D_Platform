# Seeker_2D_Platform
I finished this game project on December 2018, just upload it to github

- Playable Demo: matrixwayne.itch.io/seeker    
- Used Tilemap to build and design three game levels, polished based on more than 20 peopleâ€™s feedback.
- Scripted and optimized Jumping system and collision logic, increased 45% smoothness than before.
- Added pickup/score, checkpoint/respawn, and other game mechanics to improve a large extent of Playability.
